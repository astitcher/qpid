LinearStore issues:

Store:
------

1. (FIXED) Overwrite identity: When recovering a previously used file, if the write boundary coincides with old record
   start, no way of discriminating old from new at boundary (used to use OWI).

2. (FIXED) QPID-5357: Recycling files while in use not working, however, files are recovered to EFP during recovery. Must solve
   #1 first.

3. (FIXED) QPID-5358: Checksum not implemented in record tail, not checked during read.

4. QPID-5359: Rework qpid management parameters and controls (QMF).

5. QPID-5360: Consistent logging: rework logging to provide uniform and consistent logging from store (both logging
   level and places where logging occurs).

6. QPID-5361: No tests
   * No existing tests for linearstore:
   ** Basic broker-level tests for txn and non-txn recovery
   ** Store-level tests which check write boundary conditions
   ** Unit tests
   ** Basic performance tests

7: QPID-5362: No tools
   * Store analysis and status
   * Recovery/reading of message content

Current bugs and performance issues:
------------------------------------
1. RH Bugzilla 1035843 - Slow performance for producers
2. (FIXED) QPID-5387 (BZ 1036071) - Crash when deleting queue
3. (FIXED) QPID-5388 (BZ 1035802) - Segmentation fault when recovering empty queue
4. RH Bugzilla 1036026 - Unable to create durable queue - framing error

Code tidy-up
------------
* Remove old comments
* Use c++ cast templates instead of (xxx)y
* Member names: xxx_
* Rename classes, functions and variables to camel-case
* Add Doxygen docs to classes
